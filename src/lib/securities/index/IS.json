	"longDescription": "The Company will invest in an actively managed portfolio (the Portfolio) of securities of approximately 15 dividend-paying issuers operating in the infrastructure sector. The Advisor will invest in issuers that it believes are undervalued and well-positioned to benefit from the Advisor's outlook for a gradual reduction in interest rates, the continuation of global decarbonization, and favourable demographics (such as a growing middle class and urbanization) (Infrastructure Issuers). Following the closing of the Offering, the Company will enter into a loan facility or prime brokerage facility (the Loan Facility) with one or more Canadian chartered banks (collectively, the Lender).The Portfolio may include securities which are denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar (any such currencies being foreign currencies) and, accordingly, the Company may be exposed to foreign currency risk.",
