The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics, fundamental characteristics and liquidity measures similar to those of the Index, as more fully described in the Funds prospectus. The Funds current principal investment strategy is to invest in one or more iShares ETFs. The Fund also employs a currency hedging strategy that seeks to hedge substantially all of the Funds foreign currency back to Canadian dollars.",
