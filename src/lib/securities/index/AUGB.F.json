	"fulldescription": "The ETF seeks to provide Unitholders with returns (before fees, expenses and taxes and, in respect of the units only, any changes to the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate) that match the price return of the Underlying ETF up to a predetermined upside cap (before fees, expenses and taxes and, in respect of the units only, any changes to the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate), while providing a buffer against the first 10% (before fees, expenses and taxes and, in respect of the units only, any changes to the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate) of the decrease in market price of the Underlying ETF, over a period referred to as the Target Outcome Period To achieve its investment objectives, the ETF will under normal market conditions invest substantially all of its assets in FLexible EXchange Options (FLEX Options) that reference the price return of the Underlying ETF. The investment objective of the Underlying ETF is to seek to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the S&P 500 Index. FLEX Options are customized equity and/or index option contracts that trade on an exchange, but provide investors with the ability to customize key contract terms like exercise prices, styles and expiration dates.",
