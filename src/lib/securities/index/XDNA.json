	"longDescription": "Fund seeks to provide long-term capital growth by replicating, to the extent possible, the performance, net of expenses, of an Index selected at the discretion of BlackRock Canada that is composed of securities of issuers that could benefit from the long-term growth and innovation in genomics, immunology and bioengineering, as determined by the Index Provider. XDNA currently seeks to replicate the performance of the NYSE FactSet Global Genomics and Immuno Biopharma Index.  To achieve its investment objective the Fund uses an indexing strategy. Under this strategy, the Fund seeks to replicate the performance of the Index, net of expenses, by employing, directly or indirectly through investment in one or more exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock Canada or an affiliate and/or through the use of derivatives, a replicating strategy or sampling strategy.",

A replicating strategy is an investment strategy intended to replicate the performance of the Index by investing, directly or indirectly, primarily in a portfolio of index securities in substantially the same proportions as they are represented in the Index. A sampling strategy is an investment strategy intended to replicate the performance of the Index by investing, directly or indirectly, primarily in a representative portfolio of securities that has an aggregate investment profile similar to the Index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics, fundamental characteristics and liquidity measures similar to those of the Index, as more fully described in the Funds prospectus.",
