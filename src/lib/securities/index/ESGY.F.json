Currently, the ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the MSCI USA ESG Leaders Index (the Index). The investment strategy of the ETF is to invest in and hold the constituent securities of the Index in the same proportion as they are reflected in the Index. The Manager may also use a sampling methodology in selecting investments for the ETF. As an alternative to or in conjunction with investing in and holding the constituent securities of the Index, the ETF may invest in or use Other Securities (as defined in the prospectus) to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index.",
