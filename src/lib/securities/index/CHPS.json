CHPS may also invest in ADRs or GDRs representing equity securities of Constituent Issuers of its Underlying Index. To the extent permitted, CHPS will generally be fully invested in or exposed to its Underlying Index at all times. CHPS seeks to replicate, to the extent possible and net of expenses, the performance of an index that is designed to provide exposure to the performance of global, publicly listed companies engaged in the production and development of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment. Currently, CHPS seeks to replicate the performance of the Solactive Capped Global Semiconductor Index, net of expenses. CHPS seeks to hedge the U.S. dollar value of its portfolio to the Canadian dollar at all times.",
