In order to achieve its investment objective, IITE currently holds the Constituent Securities of the S&P Developed Ex-North America & Korea LargeMidCap ESG Tilted Index in approximately the same proportion as they are reflected in that Index and may use, at the discretion of Invesco Capital, the sampling methodology described in the prospectus. The Manager expects that IITE is likely to employ a sampling methodology from time to time. In addition, or in the alternative, IITE may hold securities of one or more Invesco portfolios that, individually or collectively, replicate or substantially replicate the applicable Index.",
