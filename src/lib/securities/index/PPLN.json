HOGs Underlying Index is ordinarily rebalanced on a quarterly basis at the close of trading on each Rebalancing Date. The Constituent Issuers of its Underlying Index will be weighted equally on each Rebalancing Date. HOG seeks to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the Solactive Pipelines  Energy Services Index, net of expenses. The Solactive Pipelines  Energy Services Index is designed to provide exposure to equity securities of certain Canadian oil and gas companies in the Midstream Sector.",
