	"longDescription": "Brompton North American Low Volatility Dividend ETF is designed to provide unitholders with stable monthly cash distributions, the opportunity for capital appreciation, and low overall volatility of portfolio returns than would otherwise be experienced by owning equity securities of North American large capitalization issuers directly. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing in an actively managed portfolio consisting of equity securities of North American issuers with a market capitalization of at least 5 billion dollars. The Fund may also invest in one or more other investment funds, including other investment funds managed by the Manager. To reduce volatility and to generate distributable income, the Manager may write covered calls. In addition, the Fund will hedge substantially all of its foreign currency exposure back to the Canadian dollar.",
