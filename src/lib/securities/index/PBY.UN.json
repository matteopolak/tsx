	"longDescription": "The investment objectives of the Fund are to maximize total returns for holders of Units (Unitholders) on a tax-advantaged basis, while reducing risk and provide Unitholders with attractive monthly tax-advantaged cash distributions; by exposure to a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of corporate bonds (the Portfolio). The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by obtaining exposure to the Portfolio. Canso tends to take a ``bottom up approach to portfolio construction, focusing on security selection and then adjusting the portfolio to stay within its duration and term targets. The exposure to credit risk in the Portfolio depends on the phase of the credit cycle and the bottom up valuation of individual securities. When credit spreads are very tight, as they were in 1997 and again in early 2007, Cansos valuation focus will concentrate the Portfolio on high quality (primarily investment grade) corporate bonds which will reduce its credit risk.",
