	"longDescription": "The ETF has been designed to provide investors with exposure to the performance of an environmental, social and governance oriented index selected at the discretion of BlackRock. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will primarily invest in Canadian fixed income securities. The Index consists of Canadian dollar investment grade corporate bonds (as determined by the index provider).  To achieve its investment objective fund uses an indexing strategy. Under this strategy, the Fund seeks to replicate the performance of the Index, net of expenses, by employing, directly or indirectly, through investment in one or more iShares ETFs and/or through the use of derivatives, a replicating strategy or sampling strategy. A replicating strategy is an investment strategy intended to replicate the performance of the Index by investing, directly or indirectly, primarily in a portfolio of index securities in substantially the same proportions as they are represented in the Index.",

The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics, fundamental characteristics and liquidity measures similar to those of the Index, as more fully described in the Funds prospectus.",
