Under normal market conditions, the Fund will primarily invest in securities of one or more exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock Canada or an affiliate (iShares ETFs) and/or U.S. equity securities. The Index measures the performance of equity securities in the top 85% by market capitalization of equity securities listed on stock exchanges in the United States. The Fund uses an indexing strategy to achieve its investment objective. The Funds current principal investment strategy is to invest in one or more iShares ETFs.",
