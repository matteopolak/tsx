	"longDescription": "Generation Mining is developing the Marathon Palladium-Copper project in Northwestern Ontario. The Company has completed a feasibility study which estimates 245,000 ounces of annual palladium-equivalent production over a 13-year mine life. Marathon is the largest undeveloped palladium project in North America. Most palladium demand is for autocatalysts in cars, which scrub toxic emissions from exhaust, making our air much cleaner and lowering greenhouse gases.",
