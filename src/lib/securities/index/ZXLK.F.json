However, the Fund may invest substantially all of its assets, directly or indirectly, in the Index Constituents, in substantially the same proportions as the Index Constituents are represented in the Index. The Fund seeks to replicate, to the extent possible before fees and expenses, the performance of an index that provides exposure to equity securities of largecapitalization issuers in the U.S. health care sector by establishing, directly or indirectly, a long or short position.",
