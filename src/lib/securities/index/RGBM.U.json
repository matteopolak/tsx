RGBM gains exposure to these asset classes by investing in derivatives and securities. The ETF is actively managed and seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in two complimentary investment strategies, a Balanced Allocation strategy and a Systematic Macro strategy. Essentially, one dollar invested in ETF provides approximately one dollar of exposure to the ETFs Balanced Allocation strategy and approximately one dollar of exposure to the ETFs Systematic Macro strategy. The return of the Systematic Macro strategy is essentially stacked on top of the returns of the Balanced Allocation strategy. The ETF uses leverage and derivatives to stack the return of the two strategies. The fund seeks longterm capital appreciation.",
