	"longDescription": "Avino is a silver producer from its wholly owned Avino Mine near Durango, Mexico. The Company's project portfolio consists of the Avino Mine, in production; La Preciosa, in development stage with production anticipated early 2026; and the Oxide Tailings Project, also a development staged asset. As per NI 43-101, Avino controls 277 million AgEq ozs of measured and indicated mineral resources and 94 million AgEq ozs of inferred mineral resources, within our district-scale land package. Early in 2024, the pre-feasibility Study on the Oxide Tailings Project was completed. As part of Avino's commitment to adopting sustainable practices, we have been operating a dry stack tailings facility for over two years now with excellent results. We are committed to managing all business activities in a safe, environmentally responsible, and cost-effective manner, while contributing to the well-being of the communities in which we operate.",
