The Index is a market capitalization-weighted index that represents a wide spectrum of public, investment-grade fixed income securities issued in Canada¿including government, government-related and corporate products¿ all with maturities between one and five years. To achieve its investment objective, the ETF employs a passive management, or indexing, investment approach designed to track the performance of the Index by holding a broadly diversified subset of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of primary risk factors, including duration, yield, quality, sector distribution and issue exposure, as well as other key characteristics of the Index",
