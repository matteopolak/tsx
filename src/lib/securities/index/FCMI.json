	"longDescription": "Fidelity Canadian Monthly High Income ETF (Fund) aims to achieve a steady flow of income with the potential for capital gains by using an asset allocation approach. It invests primarily in underlying funds. These underlying funds generally invest in a mix of Canadian and foreign equity securities and fixed income securities, with generally more emphasis on Canadian equity securities and fixed income securities. In order to achieve its investment objective, the portfolio management team generally follows a neutral mix guideline of approximately 60% equity securities and approximately 40% fixed income securities. Depending on market conditions, the portfolio management team may vary the asset mix by up to +/-20% from the neutral mix if it believes this produces the best overall return.",
