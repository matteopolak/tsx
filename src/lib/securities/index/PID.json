The investment strategy is to systematically select companies that have attractive dividend yield and the ability to grow their businesses and dividends for unitholders in the future. The portfolio is structured to reduce risk by using both quality and financial risk screens in order to exclude from the investment universe companies that have low financial strength and limited capacity for business and dividend growth. The Funds portfolio is broadly diversified by industry sector, with no one industry representing more than 20% of the NAV of the Fund.",
