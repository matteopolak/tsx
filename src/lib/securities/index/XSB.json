A replicating strategy is an investment strategy intended to replicate the performance of the Index by investing, directly or indirectly, primarily in a portfolio of index securities in substantially the same proportions as they are represented in the Index. A sampling strategy is an investment strategy intended to replicate the performance of the Index by investing, directly or indirectly, primarily in a representative portfolio of securities that has an aggregate investment profile similar to the Index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics, fundamental characteristics and liquidity measures similar to those of the Index, as more fully described in the Fund's prospectus. The Funds current principal investment strategy is to employ a sampling strategy.",
