	"longDescription": "The investment objective of TD One-Click Moderate ETF Portfolio (the Fund) is to seek to generate long-term capital growth while providing the opportunity to earn some income by investing primarily in units of other exchange-traded funds, emphasizing exchange-traded funds with greater potential for capital growth. In seeking to achieve this objective, the Fund obtains exposure to equity and fixed income securities of issuers located anywhere in the world. Such exposure will be obtained by investing primarily in units of exchange-traded funds managed by TD Asset Management Inc.; by investing directly in such securities or other income-producing securities; and/or through the use of derivatives that provide the desired exposure. The Funds moderate asset mix will generally provide exposure to 60% equities and 40% fixed income, though the Fund may also hold a significant portion of its assets in cashequivalent instruments when it is prudent to do so.",
