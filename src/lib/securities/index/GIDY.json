	"longDescription": "We employ a system-driven bottom-up research approach to assess relative value and capital growth potential within a broad stock-selection universe. We use a quantitative approach, including the use of AI technology such as machine learning, deep learning and large language models, to analyze multiple fundamental and alternative factors and incorporate financial data and other information sources relevant to the issuer, including rates of change of fundamental and alternative factors. The primary objective of the Fund is to provide longterm capital appreciation and regular distributions by investing directly and indirectly primarily in global dividendpaying securities and employing a dynamic covered call option writing strategy. The investment objectives of the Fund can only be changed with the approval of a majority of the Unitholders at a meeting called for such purpose.",
