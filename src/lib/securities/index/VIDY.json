The Index is a market capitalization-weighted index that aims to capture the performance of common stocks that are characterized by high dividend yield and located in developed markets, excluding the U.S. and Canada. The Index represents a range of industry sectors other than real estate and related sectors, such as REITS. To achieve its investment objective, the ETF employs a passive management, or indexing, investment approach designed to track the performance of the Index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.",
