The Fund If HED is successful in meeting its investment objective, its net asset value should gain approximately twice as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as any decrease in the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index when this Underlying Index declines on that given day. Conversely, HEDs net asset value should lose approximately twice as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as any increase in the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index when this Underlying Index rises on that given day. HED invests in financial instruments that have similar daily return characteristics as two times 200 Percentage the inverse opposite of the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index.",

HED invests in financial instruments that have similar daily return characteristics as two times 200 Percentage the inverse opposite of the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index. In order to achieve this objective, the total underlying notional value of these instruments and/or securities will typically not exceed two times the total assets of the ETF. As such, HED employs absolute leverage. Assets not invested in financial instruments may be invested in debt instruments or money market instruments with a term not to exceed 365 days, or reverse repurchase agreements with a term not to exceed 30 days.",
