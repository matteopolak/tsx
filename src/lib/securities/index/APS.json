The company has two clinical-stage programs and a second program that is discovery-stage and partnered with another company. Luxeptinib, its panFMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 / pan-Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is enrolling patients in a Phase 1, multicenter, open label, dose-escalation study with expansions to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of CG-806 in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL/SLL) or non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). HM43239 is an oral potent myeloid kinome inhibitor, targeting a constellation of kinases operative in myeloid malignancies.",
