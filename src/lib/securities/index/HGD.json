	"longDescription": "HGD seeks daily investment results, before fees, expenses, distributions, brokerage commissions and other transaction costs, that endeavour to correspond to two times (200%) the inverse (opposite) of the daily performance of the Solactive Canadian Gold Miners Index. If HGD is successful in meeting its investment objective, its net asset value should gain approximately twice as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as any decrease in the Solactive Canadian Gold Miners Index when this Underlying Index declines on that given day. Conversely, HGDs net asset value should lose approximately twice as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as any increase in the Solactive Canadian Gold Miners Index when this Underlying Index rises on that given day. In order to achieve this objective, the total underlying notional value of these instruments and/or securities will typically not exceed two times the total assets of the ETF. As such, HGD employs leverage.",
