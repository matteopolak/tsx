	"longDescription": "The investment objective of the Fund is to provide long-term capital growth by replicating, to the extent possible, the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets Minimum Volatility Index (USD) (the Index), net of expenses. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will primarily invest in securities of one or more exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock Canada or an affiliate (iShares ETFs) and/or equity securities of issuers located in emerging market countries. The Index aims to reflect the performance characteristics of a minimum volatility strategy applied to the large- and mid-cap securities in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (the Parent Index). The eligible universe of securities is taken from the Parent Index, which is a free-float adjusted market capitalization-weighted index, and then MSCI, Inc. follows a rules-based methodology to determine optimal weights for securities in the Index in order to seek to minimize total risk of the Index.",
