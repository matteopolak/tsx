	"longDescription": "HIU seeks daily investment results, before fees, expenses, distributions, brokerage commissions and other transaction costs, that endeavour to correspond to one times (100%) the inverse (opposite) of the daily performance of the S&P 500 (the Underlying Index, Bloomberg ticker: SPXT). Any U.S. dollar gains or losses as a result of the ETF's investment will be hedged back to the Canadian dollar to the best of its ability. If HIU is successful in meeting its investment objective, its net asset value should gain approximately as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as the S&P 500 when this Underlying Index declines on that given day. Conversely, HIU's net asset value should lose approximately as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as the S&P 500 when this Underlying Index rises on that given day. HIU takes positions in financial instruments that, in combination, should have similar daily return characteristics as one times (100%) the inverse (opposite) of the S&P 500.",

In order to achieve this objective, the total underlying notional value of these instruments will typically not exceed one times the total assets of the ETF. Assets not invested in financial instruments may be invested in debt instruments or money market instruments with a term not to exceed 365 days, or reverse repurchase agreements with a term not to exceed 30 days.",
