In order to achieve its investment objective, the Fund normally invests its assets in the Constituent Securities of the Fidelity Canada Canadian Value Index. Alternatively, this Fidelity ETF may use a sampling methodology to invest in a broadly diversified collection of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the Index in terms of key characteristics by taking into account such factors as volatility, capitalization, industry exposure, fundamental characteristics and liquidity.",
