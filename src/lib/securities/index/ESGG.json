The Manager may also use a sampling methodology in selecting investments for the ETF. As an alternative to or in conjunction with primarily investing in assets such as ETFs, mutual funds or other investment funds, ADRs or derivative instruments, the ETF may invest in and hold the constituent securities of the Index to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index.",
