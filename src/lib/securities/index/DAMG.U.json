	"longDescription": "The ETF seeks to achieve positive returns in both positive or negative equity market conditions. To achieve fund's objective the ETF primarily invests in long and/or short positions on equity index futures throughout the world and/or equity index ETFs listed in Canada or in the United States, treasury bills, money market instruments or other equivalent short term debt securities, with the objective of maximizing returns with controlled volatility and while maintaining a low correlation to traditional asset classes. Foreign currency exposure is generally hedged back to the currency in which the Units are denominated through the use of currency forward contracts. The ETF may use leverage which may be created through the use of cash borrowings, short sales and derivatives. The ETFs maximum aggregate exposure to these sources of leverage will not exceed 300 percent of its net asset value.",
