	"longDescription": "The investment objective of TD Q Canadian Dividend ETF (the Fund) is to seek to earn income and moderate capital growth by investing primarily in, or gaining exposure to, dividend-paying equity securities and other income-producing instruments of Canadian issuers. In seeking to achieve this objective, the Fund uses a quantitative equity strategy to identify and optimize exposure to common and preferred shares, as well as real estate investment trusts, with above-average dividend yields and/or issuers that are expect to pay increasing dividends over time. A quantitative equity strategy is the selection of equity securities based on mathematical or rules-based algorithm. The Fund may also invest in other exchange-traded funds.",
