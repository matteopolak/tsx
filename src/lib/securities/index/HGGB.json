Under this stratified sampling strategy, HGGB will not hold securities of all the Constituent Issuers, but instead will hold a portfolio of securities that closely matches the aggregate investment characteristics of the Constituent Issuers. HGGB seeks to replicate, to the extent possible and net of expenses, the performance of a market index that is designed  to provide exposure to the performance of global greenlabeled bonds issued in U.S. dollars that are subject to stringent  eligibility criteria to fund projects that have positive environmental or climate benefits.",
