The Manager may also use a sampling methodology in selecting investments for the ETF to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index. As an alternative to or in conjunction with investing in and holding the constituent securities, the ETF may invest in or use certain Other Securities (as defined in the prospectus) to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index.",
