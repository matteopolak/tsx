	"longDescription": "The investment objective of TD One-Click Conservative ETF Portfolio (the Fund) is to seek to earn a moderate level of income while preserving investment capital and providing some potential for capital growth by investing primarily in units of other exchangetraded funds, emphasizing exchange-traded funds with incomegenerating potential. In seeking to achieve this objective, the Fund obtains exposure to fixed income and equity securities of issuers located anywhere in the world. Such exposure will be obtained by investing primarily in units of exchange-traded funds managed by TD Asset Management Inc.; by investing directly in such securities or other income-producing securities; and/or through the use of derivatives that provide the desired exposure. The Funds conservative asset mix will generally provide exposure to 70% fixed income and 30% equities, though the Fund may also hold significant portion of its assets in cash-equivalent instruments when it is prudent to do so.",
