The Underlying Index was designed as a passively managed portfolio of global stocks which takes account of key ESG concerns. ETHI seeks to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the Nasdaq Future Global Sustainability Leaders USD Index, net of expenses. The Nasdaq Future Global Sustainability Leaders USD Index is designed to provide exposure to the performance of a basket of largecap equity securities of companies that are global climate change leaders (as measured by their relative carbon efficiency), and are not materially engaged in activities deemed inconsistent with responsible investment considerations.",
