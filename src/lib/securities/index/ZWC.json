Securities will also be subject to a screening process to ensure sufficient liquidity. Depending on market volatility and other factors, the ETF will write covered call options on these securities. Under such call options, the ETF will sell to the buyer of the option, for a premium, either a right to buy the security at an exercise price or, if the option is cash settled, the right to a payment equal to the difference between the value of the security and the exercise price. Covered call options partially hedge against a decline in the price of the securities on which they are written to the extent of the premiums received by the ETF at the time the options are written by the ETF. The call options written by the ETF may be either exchange traded options or over-the-counter options.",
