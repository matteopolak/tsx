	"longDescription": "To achieve INOCs investment objective, INOC invests and holds the equity securities of the Constituent Issuers in substantially the same proportion as its Underlying Index. The Underlying Index is ordinarily rebalanced on a quarterly basis at the close of trading on each Rebalancing Date. The Constituent Issuers of its Underlying Index will be weighted equally on each Rebalancing Date. INOC seeks to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the Nasdaq Inovestor Canada Index, net of expenses. The Nasdaq Inovestor Canada Index is a large capitalization equity index of diversified constituents which are selected largely from the Canadian equity universe.",
