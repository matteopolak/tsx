HEU invests in financial instruments that have similar daily return characteristics as two times 200 Percemtage the S&P TSX Capped Energy Index. In order to achieve this objective, the total underlying notional value of these instruments and/or securities will typically not exceed two times the total assets of the ETF. As such, HEU employs absolute leverage. Assets not invested in financial instruments may be invested in debt instruments or money market instruments with a term not to exceed 365 days, or reverse repurchase agreements with a term not to exceed 30 days.
