The qualitative ESG considerations include reviewing a company's policies and practices in regards to environmental, sustainability, diversity of employees and corporate governance. The Fund may also invest in one or more other investment funds, including other investment funds managed by the Manager. To reduce volatility and to generate distributable income, the Manager may write covered calls. In addition, the Fund will hedge substantially all of its foreign currency exposure back to the Canadian dollar.",
