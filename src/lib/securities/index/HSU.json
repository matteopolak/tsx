	"longDescription": "HSU seeks daily investment results, before fees, expenses, distributions, brokerage commissions and other transaction costs, that endeavour to correspond to two times (200%) the daily performance of the S&P 500 (the Underlying Index, Bloomberg ticker:SPXT). HSU is denominated in Canadian dollars. Any U.S. dollar gains or losses as a result of the ETF's investment will be hedged back to the Canadian dollar to the best of the ETF's ability. If HSU is successful in meeting its investment objective, its net asset value should gain approximately two times as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as the S&P 500 when this Underlying Index rises on that given day. Conversely, the HBP S&P 500 Bull ETF's net asset value should lose approximately two times as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as the S&P 500 when this Underlying Index declines on that given day.",

HSU invests in financial instruments that have similar daily return characteristics as two times (200%) the daily performance of the S&P 500. In order to achieve this objective, the total underlying notional value of these instruments will typically not exceed two times the total assets of the ETF. As such, HSU employs leverage. Assets not invested in financial instruments may be invested in debt instruments or money market instruments with a term not to exceed 365 days, or reverse repurchase agreements with a term not to exceed 30 days.",
