	"longDescription": "The fund seeks to provide interest income and long-term capital growth by investing in a diversified portfolio of primarily North American fixed income securities. Exposure to these types of fixed income securities will be obtained by investing primarily in Dynamic ATB Fund, and/or by investing directly in them, in securities of one or more Other Funds, and/or through the use of derivatives. To achieve its objective, DXB will invest primarily in a diversified portfolio of government-issued bonds and investment grade corporate bonds, although it may also invest across a full spectrum of fixed income securities, seeking to maintain an average credit rating of A- or above across the portfolio. For the purposes of determining whether securities qualify as investment grade and measuring the average credit rating of the portfolio, unrated securities may be treated as equivalent to having a particular credit rating.",
