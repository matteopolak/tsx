The assets of the Corporation are invested in a Portfolio consisting primarily of securities of issuers that are engaged in the production and/or exploration of metal and minerals, with a current focus on gold issuers. The Manager actively manages the Corporation's investments, which includes rotation of weightings within different metals and minerals. The Manager uses a combination of a top-down and value driven, bottom-up analysis to identify issuers for the Portfolio. The Manager intends to focus on equities with: ¿ high cash flow and free cash flow yields on invested capital; ¿ low multiples to NAV based on below market metal price assumptions; ¿ undervalued, in-development metal and mineral deposits that are expected to grow in value as they advance to production; ¿ advanced exploration deposits that the Manager considers to have a high probability of commercial viability and substantial potential for expansion prior to commencement of feasibility studies and production financing; and ¿ discounted financing opportunities, particularly those with additional leverage from warrants. From time to time the Portfolio will include cash and cash equivalents which may at times constitute a significant portion of the Portfolio. The Manager believes that in ordinary market conditions, cash and cash equivalents would constitute less than 10% of the NAV of the Portfolio. Subject to the Corporation's investment restrictions, the Manager may from time to time purchase physical metals and/or minerals. The Manager may, on behalf of the Corporation, from time to time, purchase futures, forward contracts, options on metals and/or minerals, and any other derivative contract relating to metals and/or minerals. The Manager may update the investment focus to securities of issuers that are engaged in the production of and/or exploration for, Other Metals.",
