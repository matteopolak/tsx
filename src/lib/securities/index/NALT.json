	"longDescription": "The ETF will aim to achieve this investment objective regardless of prevailing market conditions or general market direction. The ETF will seek to achieve this objective by investing primarily in long and short positions on financial derivatives that provide exposure to different major global asset classes, such as government bonds, currencies, equities or commodities. The ETF uses a quantitative, rules-based strategy designed to evaluate the overall current expected return, risk and correlation of the investible universe available to the ETF. The Portfolio Manager uses computer models that analyze the available information on the current interactions between different asset classes (correlation), their current risk levels and short, medium and long-term return expectations. Following this analysis, results are aggregated to automatically propose to the Portfolio Manager long and short positions that reduce risk and correlation while aiming to maintain a positive return.",
