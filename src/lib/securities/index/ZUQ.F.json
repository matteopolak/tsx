As an alternative to or in conjunction with investing in and holding the constituent securities, the ETF may invest in or use certain Other Securities (as defined in the prospectus) to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index. For the Hedged units of the ETF, the foreign currency exposure will be hedged back to the Canadian dollar.",
