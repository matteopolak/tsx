The Fund If HIX is successful in meeting its investment objective, its net asset value should gain approximately as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as any decrease in the S&P/TSX 60 Index when this Underlying Index declines on that given day. Conversely, HIXs net asset value should lose approximately as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as any increase in the S&P/TSX 60 Index when this Underlying Index rises on that given day. HIX takes positions in financial instruments that, in combination, should have similar daily return characteristics as one times 100 Percentage the inverse opposite of the S&P/TSX 60 Index.",

Assets not invested in financial instruments may be invested in debt instruments or money market instruments with a term not to exceed 365 days, or reverse repurchase agreements with a term not to exceed 30 days.
