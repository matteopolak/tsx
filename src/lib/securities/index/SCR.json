	"longDescription": "Strathcona Resources Ltd. is a Canada-based oil and gas producers with operations focused on thermal oil, enhanced oil recovery and liquids-rich natural gas. The Company has three operations, including Lloydminster Heavy Oil, Cold Lake Thermal Oil and Montney. The Lloydminster Heavy Oil segment has multiple large oil-in-place reservoirs with existing and expanding enhanced oil recovery (EOR) opportunities primarily located in southwest Saskatchewan. Its Saskatchewan thermal properties rely on the same steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) processes as its Cold Lake Thermal properties. It is a producer in the Cold Lake region of Alberta. Its operations include thermal oil producing assets at Lindbergh, Orion and Tucker, with production from SAGD oil assets. Its Montney development is positioned in some of the active regions in the Montney basin, the condensate-rich Kakwa, Grande Prairie, and Groundbirch regions, and produces liquids-rich gas.",
