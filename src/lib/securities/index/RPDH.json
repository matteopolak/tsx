Portfolio securities for the underlying RBC ETF (and for the ETF, to the extent it invests directly in equity securities) will be selected and weighted using a rules based, multi factor investment approach that considers a company's balance sheet strength, the stability and sustainability of its dividend payout and/or its ability to pay or grow dividends in the future. The portfolio holdings will be reconstituted and rebalanced on a quarterly basis. The frequency of the reconstitution and rebalancing may change without notice.",
