	"longDescription": "The AGFiQ US Equity ETF seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation with reduced volatility, over a full market cycle, by investing primarily in equity securities of issuers in the United States. In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the AGFiQ US Equity ETF uses a quantitative model to evaluate securities of U.S. large and mid capitalization issuers utilizing a minimum variance approach, in order to construct a portfolio that minimizes portfolio volatility. The quantitative model also evaluates U.S. securities based on factors that identify growth, value, quality and risk characteristics. Although the AGFiQ US Equity ETF's investments are selected based on the output of its quantitative model, the portfolio incorporates constraints/controls (in relation to country, industry, group, sector and individual security concentrations) that are designed to foster portfolio diversification, liquidity and risk mitigation.",
