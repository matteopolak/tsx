	"longDescription": "The investment objective of TD Q Canadian Low Volatility ETF (the Fund) is to seek to achieve long-term capital growth by investing directly in, or obtaining exposure to, equity securities of issuers in Canada, while seeking to reduce volatility. In seeking to achieve this objective, the Fund optimizes the portfolio by overweighting stocks that are expected to deliver less volatile returns and by underweighting, or excluding, stocks that are expected to deliver more volatile returns. The Fund uses historical standard deviation as a tool in selecting the stocks, looking at individual stocks and the correlation between stocks, with the aim of reducing volatility. As a result of this strategy, the Fund may not fully benefit from strong equity markets.",
