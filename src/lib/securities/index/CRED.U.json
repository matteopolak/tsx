The Portfolio Sub-Adviser will utilize leverage prudently to increase the expected yield of the portfolio while limiting expected volatility to be consistent with unlevered fixed income products. For example, the Portfolio Sub-Adviser may elect to hold a levered position in a corporate bond with three years to maturity instead of an unlevered bond with 10 years to maturity. ",
