The Kibi Gold Belt, which exhibits many similar geological features to Ghana's main gold belt, the Ashanti Belt, has been the subject of very limited modern exploration activity targeting lode gold deposits as virtually all past gold mining activity and exploration efforts focused on the extensive alluvial gold occurrences in many river valleys throughout the Kibi area. Its mining portfolio consists of 225.87 sq km comprised of 33.65 sq km for the Kibi project, 51.67 sq km for Banso project, 55.28 sq km for Muoso project, 44.76 sq km for the Kwabeng project, and 40.51 sq km for the Pameng project, or 55,873 acres, pursuant to the leased areas set forth in mining leases.",
