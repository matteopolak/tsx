	"longDescription": "The ETF seeks to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of a broad U.S. stock market index, net expenses. Currently, the ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 Hedged to Canadian Dollars Index (the Index). The investment strategy of the ETF is to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index by investing in assets such as ETFs, mutual funds or other investment funds, American depositary receipts or derivative instruments. Currently, the ETF primarily invests in BMO S&P 500 Index ETF and uses derivative instruments to hedge back to the Canadian dollar. As an alternative to or in conjunction with this investment strategy, the ETF may invest in and hold the constituent securities of the Index. The Manager may also use a sampling methodology in selecting investments for the ETF to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index.",
