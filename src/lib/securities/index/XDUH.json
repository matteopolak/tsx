To achieve its investment objective the fund uses an indexing strategy to achieve its investment objective. Under this strategy, the Fund seeks to replicate the performance of the Index, net of expenses, by employing, directly or indirectly, through investment in one or more iShares ETFs and/or through the use of derivatives, a replicating strategy or sampling strategy. A replicating strategy is an investment strategy intended to replicate the performance of the Index by investing, directly or indirectly, primarily in a portfolio of index securities in substantially the same proportions as they are represented in the Index.",

The Funds current principal investment strategy is to invest in one or more iShares ETFs. The Fund also employs a currency hedging strategy that seeks to hedge substantially all of the Funds foreign currency back to Canadian dollars.",
