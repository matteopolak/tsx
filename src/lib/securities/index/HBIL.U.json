	"longDescription": "HBIL will seek to achieve its investment objective by providing exposure primarily, directly or indirectly, to shorter-term U.S. Treasury securities. In conjunction with investing in and holding shorter-term U.S. Treasury securities, HBIL will invest in index-based exchange traded funds to obtain exposure to longerterm U.S. Treasury bonds. HBIL may also hold cash and cash equivalents or other money market instruments in order to meet its obligations. To mitigate downside risk and generate income, the Portfolio Adviser will actively manage an option strategy that will generally write at or near the money covered call options, at its discretion, on up to 100% of the value of HBILs longer-term U.S. Treasury bond portfolio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, HBIL may write covered call options on a lesser percentage of the longer-term U.S. Treasury bond portfolio, from time to time, at the discretion of the Portfolio Adviser.",
