The Fund may also invest in derivatives such as options, futures contracts, forward contracts, swaps and debt-like securities to hedge or protect against changes in asset class prices or foreign exchange risks. In constructing the Funds portfolio, BlackRock Canada utilizes a proprietary portfolio optimization process to estimate an efficient portfolio with a total volatility level that is consistent with a broadly diversified portfolio of Canadian fixed income securities. The optimization process is configured to estimate an efficient portfolio with a targeted long-term expected return ranging between Plus 75 and Plus 125 bps above the FTSE Canada Universe Bond Index. The configuration of the optimization process may change from time to time at BlackRock Canadas discretion, subject to the Funds investment objective.",
