Following subjective analysis of the models output, the investment manager selects securities that provide maximum exposure to the Value Factor while taking into account considerations relating to liquidity, portfolio turnover and transaction costs. The investment universe currently consists of equity securities included in the FTSE Developed All Cap Index (the Benchmark) and the Russell 3000 Index.",
