	"longDescription": "The investment objective of the Fund is to provide income by replicating, to the extent possible, the performance of the FTSE Canada HYBrid Bond Index, net of expenses. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will primarily invest in Canadian fixed income securities. The Index is a modified market capitalization-weighted index that consists of Canadian-dollar denominated corporate bonds, with a remaining term to maturity of at least one year, that are rated BBB. To achieve its investment objective the Fund uses an indexing strategy. Under this strategy, the Fund seeks to replicate the performance of the Index, net of expenses, by employing, directly or indirectly, through investment in one or more exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock Canada or an affiliate and/or through the use of derivatives, a replicating strategy or sampling strategy.",

A replicating strategy is an investment strategy intended to replicate the performance of the Index by investing, directly or indirectly, primarily in a portfolio of index securities in substantially the same proportions as they are represented in the Index. A sampling strategy is an investment strategy intended to replicate the performance of the Index by investing, directly or indirectly, primarily in a representative portfolio of securities that has an aggregate investment profile similar to the Index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics, fundamental characteristics and liquidity measures similar to those of the Index, as more fully described in the Funds prospectus. The Funds current principal investment strategy is to employ a sampling strategy.",
