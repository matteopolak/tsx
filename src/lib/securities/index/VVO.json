The investment universe currently consists of equity securities included in the FTSE Global All Cap Index Hedged to CAD (the Benchmark). The ETF will generally seek to hedge most of its currency exposure, incurred through investing in global stocks, back to the Canadian dollar. However, not all currency risk will be hedged, so the ETF will have some level of currency risk.",
