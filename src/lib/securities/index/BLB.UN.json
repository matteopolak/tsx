The Manager will build a portfolio comprised primarily of high distribution securities such as TSX-listed eligible high dividend paying common equity securities, income trusts and REITs focusing on undervalued investments that are less volatile (with a lower Beta) than the TSX as a whole, that is, they will possess a Beta of less than 1, at the time of investment. However, the Manager may continue to hold securities that do not maintain a Beta of less than 1.",
