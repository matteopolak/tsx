The ETF may use leverage which may be created through the use of cash borrowings, short sales and derivatives. The ETFs maximum aggregate exposure to these sources of leverage will not exceed 300% of its net asset value. Any foreign currency exposure of the portion of the portfolio of the ETF that is attributable to the US$ Hedged ETF series of units will be hedged back to U.S. dollars.",
