The ETF is diversified in a number of pairs of correlated issuers generally within the same industry sector that neutralize the net market value of long and short positions, thereby reducing sector biases and market exposure The ETF primarily invests, directly or indirectly, in long and short positions of equity securities of issuers located in Canada and throughout the world, treasury bills, money market instruments or other equivalent short term debt securities. The ETF may use leverage which may be created through the use of cash borrowings, short sales and derivatives. The ETFs maximum aggregate exposure to these sources of leverage will not exceed 300% of its net asset value. Any foreign currency exposure of the portion of the portfolio of the ETF that is attributable to the US$ Hedged ETF series of units will be hedged back to U.S. dollars.",
