Securities must have an investment grade rating of `A or above as determined by the index provider and a remaining effective term to maturity of between zero and ten years to be added to the Index. The Index seeks to allocate its holdings equally across ten distinct effective maturity groups. Each effective maturity group covers a one year period and together the groups cover a contiguous ten year period.",
