	"longDescription": "The ETF seeks to provide unitholders with exposure to the performance of a diversified portfolio of Canadian corporate bonds, divided (laddered) into five groupings with staggered maturities from one to five years, which will provide regular income while preserving capital. The ETF will achieve exposure to Canadian corporate bonds primarily by investing in an equal多weighted portfolio of five RBC Target Maturity Corporate Bond ETFs with remaining terms to maturity of one to five years. At the end of each year, the nearest term RBC Target Maturity Corporate Bond ETF will be sold and proceeds invested into a longer dated RBC Target Maturity Corporate Bond ETF to maintain the one to five year ladder. The portfolio holdings will be rebalanced initially on a semi多annual basis.",
