The ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the MSCI USA Quality Index (the Index). The investment strategy of the ETF is to invest in and hold the constituent securities of the Index in the same proportion as they are reflected in the Index. The Manager may use a sampling methodology in selecting investments for the ETF. As an alternative to or in conjunction with investing in and holding the constituent securities, the ETF may invest in or use certain Other Securities (as defined in the prospectus) to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index. For the Hedged units of the ETF, the foreign currency exposure will be hedged back to the Canadian dollar.",
