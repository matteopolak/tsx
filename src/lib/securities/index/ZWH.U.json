	"longDescription": "The ETF seeks to provide exposure to the performance of a portfolio of dividend paying U.S. companies to generate income and to provide long-term capital appreciation, while mitigating downside risk through the use of covered call options. The ETF will primarily invest in and hold the equity securities of dividend paying U.S. companies. Securities will be selected using a rules based methodology that considers dividend growth, yield and payout ratio. In addition, depending on market volatility and other factors, the ETF will write covered call options on these securities. Under such call options, the ETF will sell to the buyer of the option, for a premium, either a right to buy the security at an exercise price or, if the option is cash settled, the right to a payment equal to the difference between the value of the security and the exercise price.",
