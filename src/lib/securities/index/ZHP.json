	"longDescription": "The ETF seeks to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of the Solactive US Preferred Share Select Hedged to CAD Index (NTR) (the Index), net of expenses. The investment strategy of the ETF is to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index by investing in assets such as ETFs, mutual funds or other investment funds, American depositary receipts (ADRs) or derivative instruments. Currently, the ETF primarily invests in BMO US Preferred Share Index ETF and uses derivative instruments to hedge back to the Canadian dollar. As an alternative to or in conjunction with primarily investing in assets such as ETFs, mutual funds or other investment funds, ADRs or derivative instruments, the ETF may invest in and hold the constituent securities of the Index. The Manager may also use a sampling methodology in selecting investments for the ETF to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index.",
