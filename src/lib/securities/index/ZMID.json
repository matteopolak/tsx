	"longDescription": "The ETF seeks to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of a U.S. equity index, net of expenses. Currently, the ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the S&P MidCap 400 Index (the Index). The investment strategy of the ETF is to invest in and hold the constituent securities of the Index in the same proportion as they are reflected in the Index. The Manager may also use a sampling methodology in selecting investments for the ETF. As an alternative to or in conjunction with investing in the constituent securities of the Index, the ETF may invest in or use Other Securities (as defined in the prospectus) to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index. The Hedged Units of the ETF will also invest in or use derivative instruments to hedge its U.S. currency exposure back to the Canadian dollar.",
