MTAV may also invest in ADRs or  GDRs representing equity securities of constituent issuers of its Underlying Index. To the extent permitted, the ETF will  generally be fully invested in or exposed to its Underlying Index at all times. MTAV seeks to replicate, to the extent possible and net of expenses, the performance of an index that seeks to  provide exposure to global, publicly listed companies that potentially stand to benefit from the adoption and usage  of technologies expected to grow and support the functioning of the metaverse.",
