	"longDescription": "The ETF seeks to provide exposure to the performance of a portfolio of U.S. stocks to generate income and to provide long-term capital appreciation. To achieve investment objective the ETF will primarily invest in and hold securities of the issuers included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the proportions in which they are reflected in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and use derivative instruments to hedge back to the Canadian dollar. Depending on market volatility and other factors, the ETF will write covered call options on these securities. Under such call options, the ETF will sell to the buyer of the option, for a premium, either a right to buy the security from the ETF at an exercise price or, if the option is cash settled, the right to a payment from the ETF equal to the difference between the value of the security and the exercise price.",
