	"longDescription": "The ETF seeks to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of a broad U.S. high yield corporate bond market index, net of expenses. Currently, the ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield Very Liquid Index CAD Hedged (the Index). The investment strategy of the ETF is to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index by investing in assets such as ETFs, mutual funds or other investment funds, American depositary receipts or derivative instruments. The ETF primarily invests in BMO High Yield US Corporate Bond Index ETF and uses derivative instruments to hedge back to the Canadian dollar. As an alternative to or in conjunction with this investment strategy, the ETF may invest in and hold the constituent securities of the Index. The Manager may also use a sampling methodology in selecting investments for the ETF to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index.",
