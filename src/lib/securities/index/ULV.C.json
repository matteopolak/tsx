While ULV holds securities of SPLV, the reported performance of ULV and SPLV will not be the same, primarily because: (i) each of ULV and SPLV has its own fees and expenses, which will affect returns (in the case of ULV, this includes the cost of the currency forwards used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the portion of the portfolio attributable to its CAD Hedged Units back to the Canadian dollar); (ii) ULV may not be able to fully hedge the foreign currency exposure of the portion of the portfolio attributable to its CAD Hedged Units at all times; and (iii) ULV may incur withholding taxes from the income it receives from SPLV, which is listed on a U.S. exchange.
