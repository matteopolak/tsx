	"longDescription": "The investment objective of the Fund is to provide income by replicating, to the extent possible, the performance of an index that is broadly representative of the overall U.S. dollar-denominated investment grade bond market, net of expenses, and to the extent possible, hedge any resulting US dollar currency exposure back to Canadian dollars. To achieve its investment objective the Fund uses an indexing strategy. Under this strategy, the Fund seeks to replicate the performance of the Index, net of expenses, by employing, directly or indirectly, through investment in one or more iShares ETFs and/or through the use of derivatives, a replicating strategy or sampling strategy. A replicating strategy is an investment strategy intended to replicate the performance of the Index by investing, directly or indirectly, primarily in a portfolio of index securities in substantially the same proportions as they are represented in the Index.",

The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics, fundamental characteristics and liquidity measures similar to those of the Index, as more fully described in the Funds prospectus.",
