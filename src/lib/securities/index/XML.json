	"longDescription": "The investment objective of the Fund is to provide long-term capital growth by replicating, to the extent possible, the performance of the MSCI EAFE Minimum Volatility (USD) 100% Hedged to CAD Index (the Index), net of expenses, and, to the extent possible, hedge any resulting non-Canadian currency exposure back to Canadian dollars.  Under normal market conditions, the Fund will primarily invest in securities of one or more exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock Canada or an affiliate (iShares ETFs) and/or international equity securities. The Index aims to reflect the performance characteristics of a minimum volatility strategy applied to the large- and mid-cap securities in the MSCI EAFE Index. The Fund uses an indexing strategy to achieve its investment objective. The Funds current principal investment strategy is to invest in one or more iShares ETFs.",
