	"longDescription": "The ETF seeks to replicate, to the extent possible and before fees and expenses, the performance of a U.S. bank stocks index. Currently, the ETF seeks to track the Solactive U.S. Bank Yield NTR Index. The ETF expects to primarily use an index replication strategy to track as closely as possible the performance of the index. However, the ETF may use a sampling strategy to achieve its objective, if such an approach is appropriate. The Solactive U.S. Bank Yield NTR Index includes equity securities of the 21 largest banks based on market capitalization and weighted based on their indicative annual yields such that the seven highest dividend¿yielding U.S. bank stocks each receive a 7.14% weight, the next seven highest dividend¿yielding bank stocks receive a 4.76% weight and the seven lowest dividend¿yielding U.S. bank stocks each receive a 2.38% weight. The Solactive U.S. Bank Yield NTR Index will be rebalanced quarterly.",
