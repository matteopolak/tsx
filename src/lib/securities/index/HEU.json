	"longDescription": "HEU seeks daily investment results, before fees, expenses, distributions, brokerage commissions and other transaction costs, that endeavour to correspond to two times (200%) the daily performance of the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index (the Underlying Index, Bloomberg ticker: TTENAR). If HEU is successful in meeting its investment objective, its net asset value should gain approximately twice as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index when this Underlying Index rises on that given day. Conversely, HEUs net asset value should lose approximately twice as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index when this Underlying Index declines on that given day. HEU invests in financial instruments that have similar daily return characteristics as two times (200%) the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index.",

HEU invests in financial instruments that have similar daily return characteristics as two times (200%) the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index. In order to achieve this objective, the total underlying notional value of these instruments will typically not exceed two times the total assets of the ETF. As such, HEU employs leverage. Assets not invested in financial instruments may be invested in debt instruments or money market instruments with a term not to exceed 365 days, or reverse repurchase agreements with a term not to exceed 30 days.",
