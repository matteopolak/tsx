HCAL will seek to achieve its investment objective by borrowing cash to invest in and hold a proportionate share of, or a sampling of the constituent securities of, the Solactive Canadian Bank Mean Reversion Index in order to track approximately 1.25x the performance of such Index. As an alternative to, or in conjunction with investing in and holding the constituent securities, HCAL may also invest in other securities, including Other Funds (as defined herein) to obtain exposure to the constituent securities of the Index in a manner that is consistent with HCALs investment objective.",
