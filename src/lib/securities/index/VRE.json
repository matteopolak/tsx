	"longDescription": "The investment objective of Vanguard FTSE Canadian Capped REIT Index ETF (the ETF) is to track, to the extent reasonably possible and before fees and expenses, the performance of the FTSE Canada All Cap Real Estate Capped 25% Index (the Index or the Benchmark). The Index is a market capitalization-weighted index that aims to capture the performance of the publicly traded Canadian real estate sector. It is composed of securities of Canadian real estate sector issuers selected from the FTSE Canada All Cap Index, and each constituent issuers weight in the Index is capped at 25%.  To achieve its investment objective, the ETF employs a passive management, or indexing, investment approach designed to track the performance of the Index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.",
