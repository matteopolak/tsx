	"longDescription": "The ETF seeks to replicate, to the extent possible, the performance of a U.S. short term investment grade corporate bond index (CAD hedged), net of expenses. Currently, the ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the Bloomberg Barclays US Investment Grade 1 to 5 Year Corporate Bond Capped Index CAD Hedged (the Index). The investment strategy of the ETF is to invest in and hold the constituent securities of the Index in the same proportion as they are reflected in the Index and use derivative instruments to hedge back to the Canadian dollar. The Manager may also use a sampling methodology in selecting investments for the ETF. As an alternative to or in conjunction with investing in and holding the constituent securities, the ETF may invest in or use certain Other Securities (as defined in the prospectus) to obtain exposure to the performance of the Index.",
