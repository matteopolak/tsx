	"longDescription": "The investment objective of the Fund seeks to provide a floating rate of interest income while preserving capital by investing primarily in Canadian investment grade corporate bonds and through using interest rate derivatives that seek to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations. To achieve its objective, DXV will invest primarily in Canadian investment grade corporate bonds while using interest rate derivatives to minimize interest rate risk and deliver a floating rate of income. DXV may also invest in high yield securities as long as the weighted average credit rating of DXV remains BBB- or above. For the purposes of determining whether securities qualify as investment grade or high yield and measuring the weighted average credit rating of the portfolio, unrated securities may be treated as equivalent to having a particular credit rating. DXV may also: (a) invest up to 49% of DXVs assets in foreign securities and/or (b) hold cash and cash equivalents.",
