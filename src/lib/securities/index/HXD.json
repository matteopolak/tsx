	"longDescription": "HXD seeks daily investment results, before fees, expenses, distributions, brokerage commissions and other transaction costs, that endeavour to correspond to two times (200%) the inverse (opposite) of the daily performance of the S&P/TSX 60 Index (the Underlying Index, Bloomberg ticker:TX60AR). If HXD is successful in meeting its investment objective, its net asset value should gain approximately twice as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as any decrease in the S&P/TSX 60 Index when this Underlying Index declines on that given day. Conversely, HXD's net asset value should lose approximately twice as much on a given day, on a percentage basis, as any increase in the S&P/TSX 60 Index when this Underlying Index rises on that given day. HXD takes positions in financial instruments that, in combination, should have similar daily return characteristics as two times (200%) the inverse (opposite) of the S&P/TSX 60 Index.",

HXD takes positions in financial instruments that, in combination, should have similar daily return characteristics as two times (200%) the inverse (opposite) of the S&P/TSX 60 Index. In order to achieve this objective, the total underlying notional value of these instruments will typically not exceed two times the total assets of the ETF. As such, HXD employs absolute leverage. Assets not invested in financial instruments may be invested in debt instruments or money market instruments with a term not to exceed 365 days, or reverse repurchase agreements with a term not to exceed 30 days.",
