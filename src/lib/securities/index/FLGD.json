It invests primarily in dividend paying equity securities of issuers located in developed and emerging markets. To achieve its investment objective, the Fund employs a passive or indexing investment approach designed to track, before fees and expenses, the performance of the Index. The Portfolio Advisor seeks to achieve, over time, a correlation between this Franklin Index ETF's performance, before fees and expenses, and that of the Index, of 95% or better. This Franklin Index ETF invests all, or substantially all, of its assets in equity securities in developed and emerging market countries that make up the Index, holding each of the Constituent Securities of the Index in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index.",
